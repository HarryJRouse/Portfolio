                <p>Ever since I started studying game design I have always made sure to work on different side projects to improve my programming skills. I have not published any of these games
                    as they are more skills tests and small challenges that I have set for myself, as opposed to full fledged games.

                        <i>Level Design, C#, Unity</i>
                        <p>One of the first projects I did was to recreate the game Geometry Dash in  Unity. This was done in my final year of high school and helped me to wrap my head around how Unity 
                            and its 2D physics system works. It was also a great chance to mess around with the tile map system. On top of this I also made a 'side mode' that had a basic custom animation
                            and very simple procedural generation. This side mode is very barebones, but it gave me a great introduction into how procedural generation works.</p>

                        <p>The idea for this project was to design a top down shooter similar to space invaders, where the player controls a ship that can move around and shoot. I wanted to make it a boss rush
                            style game that was fast-paced and encouraged the player to learn the boss patterns to win. I have a fully playable demo that includes one simple boss fight. I planned to keep working
                            on this project at some point, but I have not found the time recently as I am focused on my studies. This project helped me work on polishing mechanics and adding in all the features
                            needed for a short, but complete game demo.</p>

                        <p>This project started out as more of a joke project. One of my friends drew a picture of what he described as a bird, me being the funny person that I am decided that it was in my best interest
                            to remake the game Angry Birds, but with his drawings. This project includes the first few levels of the original Angry Birds game and has most of the basic mechanics. It gave me a chance to
                            mess around with forces and physics in Unity and it also helped me improve my object-oriented programming skills. This was because everything in the game needed to be designed in a way that
                            was reusable across multiple levels.</p>

                        <p>This was a game I submitted for the GMTK game jam in 2024. The time limit for the jam was four days with the theme being "built to scale".
                            The game I made is a 2D puzzle platformer where then player can grow and shrink in size to move boxes and traverse the level. It has five playable
                            levels and I programmed everything myself in the Unity game engine. I did not get as much time to work on it as I would have, but this was a great
                            experience as my first game jam. The game can be downloaded and played <a target="_blank" href="https://your-pet-fish.itch.io/gmtk-scale">here</a>.</p>
