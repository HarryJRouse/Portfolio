         <div class="container">
            <p>Ever since I started studying game design I have always made sure to work on different side projects to improve my programming skills. I have not published any of these games
                as they are more skills tests and small challenges that I have set for myself, asopposed to full fledged games.

            <h2>Geometry Dash Recreation</h2>
            <p>One of the first projects I did was to reacreate the game Geometry Dash in  Unity. This was done in my final year of high school and helped me to wrap my head around how Unity 
                and its 2D physics system works. It was also a great chance to mess around with the tilemap system. On top of this I also made a 'side mode' that had a basic custom animation
                and very simple procedural generation. This side mode is very barebones, but it gave me a great introduction into how procedural generation works.

            <h2>Top Down Shooter</h2>
            <p>The idea for this project was to design a top down shooter similar to space invaders, where the player controls a ship that can move around and shoot. I wanted to make it a boss rush
                style game that was fast-paced and encouraged the player to learn the boss patterns to win. I have a fully playable demo that includes one simple boss fight. I planned to keep working
                on this project at some point, but I have not found the time recently as I am focused on my studies. This project helped me work on polishing mechanics and adding in all of the features
                needed for a short, but complete game demo.

            <h2>Angy Birds Remake</h2>
            <p>This project started out as more of a joke project. One of my friends drew a picture of what he described as a bird, me being the funny person that I am decided that it was in my best intrest
                to remake the game Angry Birds, but with his drawings. This project includes the first few levels of the original Angry Birds game and has most of the basic mechanics. It gave me a chance to
                mess around with forces and physics in Unity and it also helped me improve my object oriented programming skills. This was beacuse everything in the game needed to be designed in a way that
                was reusable across multiple levels.
