                <p>In 2023 I had the oppurtunity to partake in a University of South Australia Vaction Research Scholarship. This was a 8 week project that took place during the 
                    summer break, where I conducted my own reaserch on a topic related to my area of study. My research focused on creating a design space for massively multitouch games.
                    Throughout the duration of the scholarship I created 6 short games that all focused on different design ideas and aspects of massively multitouch games. These were
                    all created using Unity and the GitHub repositry for them can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/HarryJRouse/Massively-multitouch-games">here</a>.

                        <h2>Card Match</h2>
                        <p>This demo is similar to the classic card game Memory, where players have to flip over 2 cards in an attempt to find a matching pair. In this version up to 8 players search for matching cards and drag them into thier "card zones" to earn points.</p>

                        <h2>Drawing Game</h2>
                        <p>This demo is similar to Pictionary, where the drawers are given a word or phrase to draw and the guesser has to guess what they are deawing. The catch here is that the guesser sees all of the drawings stacked on top of each other. This game was more of a demonstration of how drawing works on the touchscreen.</p>

                        <h2>Laser Game</h2>
                        <p>In this demo there is 1 player that controls a small square using a controller or keyboard. Thier goal is to collect as many randomly spawned coins as possible. There are 6 cannons on the screen that are used by everyone else to eliminate the controller player. This game was designed to see how players felt when there was a major difference in the way they played.</p>

                        <h2>Mini Games</h2>
                        <p>This demo is similar to WarioWare where 2 players are given a short minigame to complete. The first person to complete it gets a point and another minigame is presented. This happens until 1 of the players reaches 7 points. This was the first game I made and it was used to demonstrate different types of touch interactions.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Cooking Game</h2>
                        <p>This demo is similar to overcooked in that orders are given to the player(s) and they have to prepare ingredients to complete the dish in a certain amount of time to gain points. This was made to see what types of interactions players had when they were working together.</p>

                        <h2>Physics Game</h2>
                        <p>In this demo a ball is dropped on either side of the screen and the players have to move objects around to guide it into a colored box corresponding to a pattern they are given. This was the last demo I made and is the least polished. It was made to test out different physics interactions.</p>
