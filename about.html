            <p class="nextToImage">My name is Harrison Rouse, I am a third  year student at the University of South Australia. I am studying a Bachelor of Information Technology, majouring in Games and Entertainment Design.</p>
            <p class="nextToImage">I have plenty of programming experience from my three years of uni, two certificate courses and research scholarship. I am always working on small side projectes to increase my game design and programming skills. I mostly use Unity for my games but I have experience in Unreal Engine. I am also profficient in Python and have skills in Java, C++ and C#.</p>
            <p class="nextToImage">My favourite video games are Titanfall 2, Celeste and Subnautica due to their unique movement mechanics and engaging storytelling. I someday hope to create a video game that I believe is to same standard as these games and gives players the same joy that I get from playing video games.</p><img class="image" src="Images\IMG-20230106-WA0008.jpg">
