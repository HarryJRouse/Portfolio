                <h1>University Projects</h1>
                <p>I completed a Bachelor of Information Technology majouring in Games and Entertainment Design at the University of South Australia in 2024. Throughout this course
                    I have had the oppurtunity to work on multiple projects that have improved my coding, teamworking and agile development skills. Here are some the ones that stand out the most:

                    <div>
                        <h2>ScoreShooters</h2>
                        <p>During my bachelors degree I had the oppurtunity to complete an ICT Capstone Project, where me and one other person partnered with the Australian Research Centre for Interactive
                            and Virtual Environments (IVE). We were tasked to design a novel game for the Meta Quest 3 that showed off some of the features of the device. We decided to create a game that
                            utilised the headsets passthrough capabilities in a multiplayer setting that we ended up calling ScoreShooters.</p>

                        <h2>MOBA Style Game</h2>
                        <p>This game plays similar to League of Legends where the character is controlled by the mouse. The player can move the character 
                            by left clicking where they want to go and attack enemy minions and towers by right clicking on them. The player also has access to three abilities that help them to clear out minion
                            waves and get to the enemy base. Some of the interesting systems I worked on for this project were: a modular character script that makes it simple to create new characters with unique
                            attacks and abilities, a simple wave spawning system for the minions, utilising the unity navmesh system for player and minion movement.</p>

                        <h2>Star Eater</h2>
                        <p>This was a game that was made as a part of a game design course in my second year. This was made in Unreal Engine with 3 other people. The goal of this project was to go through
                            the entire game design process, from coming up with the idea, to pitching the idea and to finally presenting a short demo. The idea for the game was to do something similar to games
                            like Cult of the Lamb and Bear and Breakfast, where the gameplay is split into 2 different parts. For our game the player switches between hunting slimes, sneaking into thier spaceport
                            and managing the spaceport. This combined 3 different game generes into one game (top down shooter, stealth and management). The parts that I focused on were the hunting section and
                            switching between modes. I also made a very basic save and load system. Below is the trailer for the game.</p>

                        <h2>Doctor Who Game</h2>
                        <p>This game was made as a part of a 4 week studio course in my second year. The goal was to make an educational game that used the Doctor Who ip. I worked in a team of 5 people to make a
                            puzzle game. The goal of the game is to guide a laser being shot from the sonic screwdriver through obstacles to hit a dalek. We had 4 worlds with 3 levels in each of them, with each 
                            world introducing a new mechanic to the game. I did a majority of the programming in this game as my group members did everything else like writing the script and designing assets. This
                            was a great oppurtunity to make a game to fit certain design requirements with a team. I greatly improved my Unity and C# skills during this project as well as my teamwork skills.</p>

                        <h2>Mobile Puzzle Game</h2>
                        <p>This game was made as part of an Android game development course. It is a puzzle game where the goal is to guide a fox to the end of each level by placing down springs and other interactables.
                            Each level has traps to avoid and the fox moves automatically once the play button is pressed. I worked on this project with one other person and I did the programming for the level grid system
                            and the tile drag and drop and inventory system. I also made a few of the levels for the game as well as the level creation and loading system. This project was made in Android Stuido and taught
                            me a lot about mobile game development.

                        <p>This game was also made as a part of the previously mentioned Android game development course. It is an endless runner similar to JetPack Joyride where the aim is to avoid obstacles and shoot enemies to
                            get as far as you can. This was a solo project in Android Studio and it has a full main menu and game loop. I also did some of the art for this game and I also made the background music.
