            <p>I am currently in the final year of a Bachelor of Information Technology majouring in Games and Entertainment Design at the University of South Australia. Throughout this course
                I have had the oppurtunity to work on multiple projects that have improved my coding, teamworking and agile development skills. Here are some the ones that stand out the most:
            </p>
            <h2>Star Eater</h2>
            <p>This was a game that was made as a part of a game design course in my second year. This was made in Unreal Engine with 3 other people. The goal of this project was to go through
                the entire game design process, from coming up with the idea, to pitching the idea and to finally presenting a short demo. The idea for the game was to do something similar to games
                like Cult of the Lamb and Bear and Breakfast, where the gameplay is split into 2 different parts. For our game the player switches between hunting slimes, sneaking into thier spaceport
                and managing the spaceport. This combined 3 different game generes into one game (top down shooter, stealth and management). The parts that I focused on were the hunting section and
                switching between modes. I also made a very basic save and load system. Below is the trailer for the game (sorry for the bad quality).

            <h2>Doctor Who Game</h2>
            <p>This game was made as a part of a 4 week studio course in my second year. The goal was to make an educational game that used the Doctor Who ip. I worked in a team of 5 people to make a
                puzzle game. The goal of the game is to guide a laser being shot from the sonic screwdriver through obstacles to hit a dalek. We had 4 worlds with 3 levels in each of them, with each 
                world introducing a new mechanic to the game. I did a majority of the programming in this game as my group members did everything else like writing the script and designing assets. This
                was a great oppurtunity to make a game to fit certain design requirements with a team. I greatly improved my Unity and C# skills during this project as well as my teamwork skills.
