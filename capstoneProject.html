            <p>During my bachelors degree I had the oppurtunity to complete an ICT Capstone Project, where me and one other person partnered with the Australian Research Centre for Interactive
                and Virtual Environments (IVE). We were tasked to design a novel game for the Meta Quest 3 that showed off some of the features of the device. We decided to create a game that
                utilised the headsets passthrough capabilities in a multiplayer setting that we ended up calling ScoreShooters.

            <h2>ScoreShooters</h2>
            <p>ScoreShooters is a mixed reality multiplayer game that utilises the Meta Quest 3s passthrough features. In in two players face off against each other with the goal of picking up
                weapons and hitting targets. Weapons and targets are spawned around the players surroundings and each player must rush for a weapon of their choice to get to the targets first.
                This game was developed in Unity with the Meta packages and Photon Fusion 2. Throughout the project I learnt how to develop a networked game and how to develop for mixed reality
                platforms.
